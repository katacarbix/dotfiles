# dotfiles
These are all the configuration files I use to get my setup to look and behave how it does. Here's a list each program with a brief explanation.

## atom
Uses [my theme](https://github.com/katacarbix/atom-bliss-blur-ui) plus some custom styles to use pywal colors.

## compton
[tryone144/compton:dual_kawase](https://github.com/tryone144/compton/tree/dual_kawase) for that sweet blur.

## dunst
Config file for the `dunst` notification handler

## fish
Trying out `fish` currently, we'll see how it goes. I'm using the `bobthefish` theme from [Oh My Fish](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish).

## i3
Specifically, [i3-gaps](https://github.com/Airblader/i3/tree/gaps).

## kitty
`$ meow!`

## neofetch
[dylanaraps/neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch)

## polybar
Started with theme 4 from [adi1090x/polybar-themes](https://github.com/adi1090x/polybar-themes) and heavily modified to taste. Could do with some cleaning up...

## ranger
Just some basic changes to the default configs.

## rofi
My simple configuration which uses pywal colors.

## rsync
Contains a list of files and directories to exclude when backing up `/home`.

## vivaldi
I recently switched to Vivaldi from Firefox. I enabled custom CSS in `vivaldi://experiments` and set the directory to here. The script `vivwal` updates the colors, which requires Vivaldi to be started with the `--remote-debugging-port=9222` flag.

## wal
The piece that arguably ties it all together. I made a few templates to get the results I want.

## .xsessionrc
A script that runs when an X session starts.

## .zshrc
Nothing special. Uses [oh my zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh).

## scripts
A bunch of scripts in various languages that help me simplify common tasks. All authored by me unless stated otherwise in comments.
