# dotfiles

These are all the configuration files I use to get my setup to look and behave how it does. Here's a list each program with a brief explanation.

## android messages

[An Electron app](https://gitlab.com/katacarbix/android-messages) I made. The custom CSS goes in `~/.config/android-messages/css/`.

## atom

Uses [my theme](https://github.com/katacarbix/atom-bliss-blur-ui) plus some custom styles to use pywal colors.

## compton

[tryone144/compton:dual_kawase](https://github.com/tryone144/compton/tree/dual_kawase) for that sweet blur.

## discord

(coming soon)

## dunst

Config file for the `dunst` notification handler

## firefox

`userChrome.css` to remove some ugly borders and whatnot. I'm also using the [Pywalfox](https://github.com/frewacom/Pywalfox) extension.

## i3

Specifically, [i3-gaps](https://github.com/Airblader/i3/tree/gaps).

## kitty

`$ meow!`

## neofetch

[dylanaraps/neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch)

## polybar

Started with theme 4 from [adi1090x/polybar-themes](https://github.com/adi1090x/polybar-themes) and heavily modified to taste.

## ranger

Just some basic changes to the default config.

## rofi

My basic configuration which uses pywal colors.

## wal

The piece that arguably ties it all together. I made a few templates to get the results I want.

## xsessionrc

Binds `insert` as compose key.

## zshrc

Nothing special. Uses [oh my zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh).

## scripts

A bunch of scripts in various languages that help me simplify common tasks. All authored by me unless stated otherwise in comments.
